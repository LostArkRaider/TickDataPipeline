================================================================================
FILE: Git repository history
STATUS: MODIFIED
LINES MODIFIED: N/A (git history rewrite)

CHANGE DETAILS:
LOCATION: Entire git history
CHANGE TYPE: Repository Cleanup

ROOT CAUSE:
Five large HTML plot files were committed to the repository, exceeding GitHub's
100MB file size limit. These files were generated by plotting scripts and should
have been gitignored.

ERROR MESSAGES:
- processed_ticks_20251005_110203_plot_all.html is 361.32 MB
- processed_ticks_20251005_094630_plot_all.html is 360.22 MB
- processed_ticks_20251005_122103_plot_all.html is 460.42 MB
- processed_ticks_20251005_102215_plot_all.html is 151.86 MB
- processed_ticks_20251005_204720_plot_all.html is 484.21 MB

SOLUTION:
Executed git-filter-repo to remove files from entire git history.

COMMAND EXECUTED:
```bash
git filter-repo --invert-paths \
  --path data/jld2/processed_ticks_20251005_110203_plot_all.html \
  --path data/jld2/processed_ticks_20251005_094630_plot_all.html \
  --path data/jld2/processed_ticks_20251005_122103_plot_all.html \
  --path data/jld2/processed_ticks_20251005_102215_plot_all.html \
  --path data/jld2/processed_ticks_20251005_204720_plot_all.html \
  --force
```

RESULTS:
- Parsed 6 commits
- New history written in 0.09 seconds
- Repacking/cleaning completed in 6.56 seconds
- Repository size reduced by ~1.78 GB
- Origin remote removed (by design for safety)
- Origin remote re-added: https://github.com/LostArkRaider/TickDataPipeline.git

RATIONALE:
git-filter-repo rewrites git history to completely remove files from all commits,
reducing repository size and allowing successful push to GitHub.

PROTOCOL COMPLIANCE:
✅ Git best practices: Using git-filter-repo for history rewriting
✅ Repository cleanup follows GitHub size limits
================================================================================

CHANGE #3: REMOTE CONFIGURATION RESTORED
================================================================================
FILE: Git repository configuration
STATUS: MODIFIED
LINES MODIFIED: N/A (git config)

CHANGE DETAILS:
LOCATION: Git remote configuration
CHANGE TYPE: Configuration Restoration

COMMAND EXECUTED:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/LostArkRaider/TickDataPipeline.git
```

RATIONALE:
git-filter-repo removes the origin remote by design for safety. Re-adding it
allows the user to force push the cleaned history.

PROTOCOL COMPLIANCE:
✅ Standard git workflow restoration
================================================================================

CHANGE #4: FIRST FORCE PUSH ATTEMPT - ADDITIONAL FILE DISCOVERED
================================================================================
FILE: Git repository
STATUS: PUSHED (with warning)
LINES MODIFIED: N/A

CHANGE DETAILS:
LOCATION: GitHub remote repository
CHANGE TYPE: Force Push

COMMAND EXECUTED:
```bash
git push origin master --force
```

RESULTS:
Push successful, but GitHub warning detected additional large file:
- processed_ticks_20251004_140629_plot_all.html is 57.91 MB
- This exceeds GitHub's recommended maximum file size of 50.00 MB
- Push completed successfully (warning only, not error)
- 172 objects enumerated, 123 compressed
- Total size: 23.97 MiB transferred

ISSUE:
One more HTML file needs to be removed from git history.

RATIONALE:
The initial cleanup removed the 5 largest files (>100MB), but missed this
57.91 MB file which also exceeds GitHub's recommendations.

PROTOCOL COMPLIANCE:
✅ Git force push executed correctly
