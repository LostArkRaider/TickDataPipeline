# Session Log - Bug Fixes & Optimization

**Date:** 2025-10-05 (Continuation Session)
**Objective:** Fix QUAD-4 complexification, resolve flat I/Q signals, optimize AGC, achieve price/volume symmetry
**Context:** Continued from previous sessions with all 8 implementation sessions complete, 100% tests passing

---

## Session Summary

This session focused on debugging and fixing critical signal processing issues in the TickDataPipeline, specifically:
1. QUAD-4 rotation not producing I/Q signals
2. Flat I/Q signals in certain data regions
3. AGC time constant optimization
4. Price/volume domain symmetry

---

## Change Entries

### Change 1: Fixed QUAD-4 Rotation Implementation

**File:** `src/TickHotLoopF32.jl`

**Problem:** Q signal (imaginary component) was flat line. User discovered complex signals not being generated correctly.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Missing QUAD4 constant tuple
- Incorrect rotation implementation
- Using `state.tick_count` instead of `msg.tick_idx` for phase calculation

**Before:**
```julia
# No QUAD4 constant defined
# Phase calculation used wrong counter
phase = phase_pos_global(Int64(state.tick_count))
```

**After (Line 10):**
```julia
const QUAD4 = (ComplexF32(1, 0), ComplexF32(0, 1), ComplexF32(-1, 0), ComplexF32(0, -1))
```

**After (Line 82):**
```julia
@inline function apply_quad4_rotation(normalized_value::Float32, phase_pos::Int32)::ComplexF32
    phase = (phase_pos & Int32(3)) + Int32(1)  # Bitwise AND for fast modulo-4
    return normalized_value * QUAD4[phase]
end
```

**After (Line 228):**
```julia
phase = phase_pos_global(Int64(msg.tick_idx))  # Use msg.tick_idx, not state.tick_count
```

**Removed (Line 146):**
```julia
# Removed: state.tick_count += Int64(1)  # Unused counter
```

**Result:** I/Q signals properly complexified with 4-phase rotation

---

### Change 2: Fixed Plot Downsampling to Preserve QUAD-4 Phases

**File:** `scripts/plot_jld2_data.jl`

**Problem:** Even with CSV showing non-zero I/Q values, plot showed flat Q signal

**Root Cause:** Downsampling with step=8 only sampled indices 1, 9, 17, 25... (all phase 0 = Real only)

**Before:**
```julia
step = div(length(tick_idx), max_points)
indices = [1:step:length(tick_idx)]  # Only captures phase 0
```

**After:**
```julia
# Sample all 4 QUAD-4 phases by taking groups of 4 consecutive samples
step = div(length(tick_idx), max_points)
step = max(1, step)
indices = Int[]
i = 1
while i <= length(tick_idx) - 3
    # Take 4 consecutive samples (all phases)
    push!(indices, i, i+1, i+2, i+3)
    # Skip ahead by step*4 to next group
    i += step * 4
end
```

**Result:** Plot correctly shows both I and Q signals

---

### Change 3: Corrected Price Validation Range

**File:** `src/PipelineConfig.jl`

**Problem:** Flat I/Q signals at tick ranges 2,214,980 to 2,224,461. AGC stuck at 1.0 with status_flag=2 (FLAG_HOLDLAST)

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Created `scripts/find_price_range.jl` to analyze actual data
- Actual price range: 36712-43148
- Config had min_price=39000, rejecting 2,288 price points below 39000
- Rejected ticks triggered FLAG_HOLDLAST path with normalization=1.0 and zero I/Q

**Before (Lines 36-37):**
```julia
min_price::Int32 = Int32(39000),
max_price::Int32 = Int32(44000),
```

**After (Lines 36-37):**
```julia
min_price::Int32 = Int32(36600),
max_price::Int32 = Int32(43300),
```

**Result:** All ticks now pass validation, no more FLAG_HOLDLAST rejections, I/Q signals continuous

---

### Change 4: Optimized AGC Time Constant

**File:** `src/PipelineConfig.jl`

**Problem:** AGC too slow to adapt during volatility regime changes, causing flat I/Q during low volatility after high volatility

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- AGC uses EMA: `ema_abs_delta = ema_abs_delta + ((abs_delta - ema_abs_delta) * agc_alpha)`
- With α=1/16 (0.0625), takes ~73 samples for 99% adaptation
- After high volatility (agc_scale=40), low volatility deltas (1-2) produce tiny normalized_ratio (0.025)
- Takes 500+ ticks for AGC to adapt down

**Before (Line 32):**
```julia
agc_alpha::Float32 = Float32(0.0625),  # 1/16
```

**After (Line 32):**
```julia
agc_alpha::Float32 = Float32(0.125),  # 1/8 - 2x faster
```

**Result:** AGC adapts in ~36 samples instead of ~73, reduces flat I/Q duration

---

### Change 5: Achieved Price/Volume Symmetry

**File:** `src/TickHotLoopF32.jl`

**Problem:** Price signals had ±3.0 range while volume has [0,1] range - 6x asymmetry in price/volume domain

**Design Decision:** Scale price delta to ±0.5 range to match volume's [0,1] span

**Implementation (Lines 227-231):**
```julia
# Winsorization (ALWAYS ENABLED)
if abs(normalized_ratio) > winsorize_threshold
    normalized_ratio = sign(normalized_ratio) * winsorize_threshold
    flag |= FLAG_CLIPPED
end

# Scale to ±0.5 range for price/volume symmetry (winsorize_threshold=3.0 → ±0.5)
normalized_ratio = normalized_ratio / Float32(6.0)

# Normalization factor includes both AGC scale and 1/6 adjustment
# To recover price_delta: complex_signal_real × normalization_factor = price_delta
normalization_factor = Float32(agc_scale) * Float32(6.0)
```

**Result:**
- I/Q outputs in ±0.5 range
- Recovery formula works: `complex_signal_real × normalization_factor = price_delta`
- Perfect symmetry with volume [0,1]

---

### Change 6: Enhanced Plotting with AGC Visualization

**File:** `scripts/plot_jld2_data.jl`

**Changes:**
1. Added AGC scale to plot (lines 30, 48, 119-124)
2. 6x scaling for I/Q visibility (lines 67-68)
3. Increased offsets to ±1.0 for better separation (lines 67-68)
4. Command-line arguments for section plotting (lines 187-197)

**Result:** Can visualize AGC behavior alongside I/Q signals to diagnose issues

---

### Change 7: Created Analysis and Utility Scripts

**New Scripts Created:**

1. **scripts/stream_ticks_to_jld2.jl**
   - Streams all ticks through pipeline to JLD2 file
   - Configurable tick delay and record limits
   - MONITORING consumer for non-blocking operation

2. **scripts/plot_jld2_data.jl**
   - Interactive HTML plots with PlotlyJS
   - Dual y-axes, section plotting support
   - Command-line args: `[jld2_file] [start_tick] [num_ticks]`

3. **scripts/jld2_to_csv.jl**
   - Exports JLD2 to CSV for analysis

4. **scripts/analyze_winsorization.jl**
   - Analyzes normalized delta distribution
   - Computes statistics, percentiles, outlier counts
   - Recommends optimal threshold
   - **Finding:** Only 0.005% clipped at 3σ (19/1M ticks)

5. **scripts/find_price_range.jl**
   - Finds min/max raw prices in tick file
   - Recommends config settings with safety margin
   - **Finding:** Actual range 36712-43148 vs config 39000-44000
