# Bar Processing: Boxcar vs FIR Filter

## Summary
The TickDataPipeline supports two bar aggregation methods:
1. **Boxcar**: Simple averaging (fast, some aliasing)
2. **FIR**: Anti-aliasing FIR filter using Parks-McClellan (Remez) algorithm (high quality, no aliasing)

The system **automatically designs the optimal FIR filter** for whatever bar size you configure - no manual filter design required!

## Quick Start

### Using Boxcar (Default)
```toml
[bar_processing]
enabled = true
ticks_per_bar = 21
bar_method = "boxcar"
normalization_window_bars = 120
```

### Using FIR Filter
```toml
[bar_processing]
enabled = true
ticks_per_bar = 21
bar_method = "FIR"
normalization_window_bars = 120
```

**That's it!** The FIR filter is automatically designed when the pipeline starts.

## Automatic FIR Filter Design

### How It Works

When you set `bar_method = "FIR"`, the system:

1. **Reads your configuration** at startup
2. **Automatically calculates** the optimal filter order using the Kaiser formula
3. **Designs the filter** using Parks-McClellan (Remez) algorithm
4. **Allocates memory** for the circular buffer
5. **Logs the results**:
   ```
   [ Info: FIR filter initialized decimation_factor=21 filter_length=1087 group_delay=543
   ```

**You never need to run a separate filter design script!**

### Changing Bar Size

To use different bar sizes, just change the config:

```toml
# For 13-tick bars
ticks_per_bar = 13          # FIR auto-designs with ~653 taps, group delay = 326

# For 21-tick bars (default)
ticks_per_bar = 21          # FIR auto-designs with 1087 taps, group delay = 543

# For 34-tick bars
ticks_per_bar = 34          # FIR auto-designs with ~401 taps, group delay = 200
```

The FIR filter automatically adjusts to maintain:
- **80 dB stopband attenuation** (prevents aliasing)
- **0.1 dB passband ripple** (minimal signal distortion)
- **Passband edge at 80% of Nyquist** (optimal transition band)

### What About the design_bar_filter.jl Script?

The standalone `design_bar_filter.jl` script you may have seen is **optional** and for:
- **Educational purposes** - understand how FIR filter design works
- **Validation** - verify filter specifications before deployment
- **Visualization** - see frequency response plots
- **One-time analysis** - analyze trade-offs for different bar sizes

**You do NOT need to run this script for production!** The production code does everything automatically.

## Technical Comparison

### Boxcar Method
- **Algorithm**: Simple average of (high + low + close) / 3
- **Taps**: 1 (instantaneous)
- **Memory**: Minimal (~20 bytes)
- **Computation**: O(1) per tick
- **Group delay**: 0 samples
- **Aliasing**: Yes - high-frequency content aliases into bar signal
- **Use case**: Fast prototyping, non-critical applications, when aliasing is acceptable

### FIR Filter Method
- **Algorithm**: Parks-McClellan optimal equiripple FIR (auto-designed)
- **Taps**: Automatically calculated (653 for M=13, 1087 for M=21, 401 for M=34)
- **Memory**: ~2-4 KB depending on bar size
- **Computation**: N multiply-accumulate operations per tick (where N = number of taps)
- **Group delay**: (N-1)/2 samples (326 for M=13, 543 for M=21, 200 for M=34)
- **Passband**: DC to 80% of new Nyquist (≤0.1 dB ripple)
- **Stopband**: Nyquist to fs/2 (≥80 dB attenuation)
- **Aliasing**: Prevented through proper anti-aliasing filtering
- **Use case**: Production systems requiring high-quality signals, when aliasing must be minimized

## Filter Specifications for Common Bar Sizes

| Bar Size (M) | Filter Taps | Group Delay | Transition Width | Memory | MACs/tick |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|------------------|--------|-----------|
| **8 ticks**  | ~1766       | 883 samples | 1.54% of fs/2    | 7.1 KB | 1,766     |
| **13 ticks** | ~653        | 326 samples | 1.54% of fs/2    | 2.6 KB | 653       |
| **21 ticks** | 1087        | 543 samples | 0.95% of fs/2    | 4.3 KB | 1,087     |
| **34 ticks** | ~401        | 200 samples | 0.59% of fs/2    | 1.6 KB | 401       |
| **55 ticks** | ~248        | 124 samples | 0.36% of fs/2    | 1.0 KB | 248       |

All filters maintain the same quality (80 dB stopband, 0.1 dB passband ripple).

**Key insight**: Larger M (more ticks per bar) requires **narrower** transition bands relative to sampling frequency, which requires **more taps** despite having a larger Nyquist frequency.

## Changing Bar Size: Complete Configuration

When changing `ticks_per_bar`, you must adjust several interdependent parameters to maintain signal fidelity:

### Example: Switching from 21-tick to 13-tick Bars

**DON'T just change `ticks_per_bar`!** Update all related parameters:

```toml
[bar_processing]
enabled = true

# Primary change
ticks_per_bar = 13              # Changed from 21

# Method selection (FIR auto-designs for M=13)
bar_method = "FIR"

# Adjust normalization window to maintain ~2,600 tick window
normalization_window_bars = 200  # Changed from 120 (200 bars × 13 ticks = 2,600 ticks)

# Scale thresholds proportionally (13/21 = 0.62)
winsorize_bar_threshold = 31     # Changed from 50 (50 × 0.62 ≈ 31)
max_bar_jump = 62                # Changed from 100 (100 × 0.62 ≈ 62)

# Monitor this - may need adjustment
bar_derivative_imag_scale = 4.0  # Start same as M=21, adjust based on results
```

### Why Each Parameter Matters

| Parameter | Purpose | Scaling Rule |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| **ticks_per_bar** | Bar size | Your choice (Fibonacci numbers recommended) |
| **normalization_window_bars** | Statistical window size | Keep total ticks constant (~2,500-3,000 ticks) |
| **winsorize_bar_threshold** | Outlier clipping | Scale by M_new/M_old |
| **max_bar_jump** | Anomaly detection | Scale by M_new/M_old |
| **bar_derivative_imag_scale** | Velocity scaling | Start same, monitor empirically |
| **bar_method** | Aggregation algorithm | "boxcar" or "FIR" |

### Parameter Calculator for Common Bar Sizes

| M | Norm Window | Total Ticks | Winsorize | Max Jump | Scale Factor |
|---|-------------|-------------|-----------|----------|--------------|
| 8  | 325 bars | 2,600 | 19 | 38 | 0.38 |
| 13 | 200 bars | 2,600 | 31 | 62 | 0.62 |
| 21 | 124 bars | 2,604 | 50 | 100 | 1.00 |
| 34 | 76 bars  | 2,584 | 81 | 162 | 1.62 |
| 55 | 47 bars  | 2,585 | 131 | 262 | 2.62 |

**Formula**: `threshold_new = threshold_M21 × (M_new / 21)`

## Performance Considerations

**Memory Usage:**
- Boxcar: ~20 bytes (OHLC state only)
- FIR: 2-7 KB depending on bar size (circular buffer + coefficients)

**Computational Cost (per tick):**
- Boxcar: ~3 operations (negligible)
- FIR: N multiply-accumulate operations (where N = filter taps)

**Throughput Impact (at 10,000 ticks/second):**
- Boxcar: Negligible overhead
- FIR M=13: ~6.5 million multiply-adds per second
- FIR M=21: ~10.9 million multiply-adds per second
- FIR M=34: ~4.0 million multiply-adds per second

Modern CPUs can handle >10 GFLOPS, so even M=21 FIR filtering uses <0.11% of available compute.

## Filter Design Details

### Automatic Design Process

When you start the pipeline with `bar_method = "FIR"`:

```julia
# Automatically called during initialization
fir_coeffs = design_decimation_filter(config.ticks_per_bar)
```

The `design_decimation_filter()` function:
1. Calculates new Nyquist frequency: `f_nyquist = fs / (2M)`
2. Sets passband edge: `f_pass = 0.8 × f_nyquist`
3. Sets stopband edge: `f_stop = f_nyquist`
4. Converts dB specs to linear deviations
5. Uses **Kaiser formula** to estimate optimal filter order:
   ```
   N ≈ (A - 8) / (2.285 × 2π × Δf / fs)
   ```
6. Ensures even order (Type I linear phase)
7. Calls DSP.jl `remez()` function (Parks-McClellan algorithm)
8. Returns optimized filter coefficients

**All of this happens automatically in milliseconds at startup!**

### Filter Quality Specifications

All FIR filters maintain these specifications regardless of bar size:
- **Passband ripple**: ≤0.1 dB (minimal signal distortion)
- **Stopband attenuation**: ≥80 dB (excellent aliasing rejection)
- **Phase response**: Linear (constant group delay, no phase distortion)
- **Design method**: Parks-McClellan (optimal equiripple)

### Why Different Bar Sizes Need Different Filter Lengths

**Counter-intuitive fact**: Larger M (more ticks per bar) often needs **more filter taps**, not fewer!

**Explanation**: 
- The **transition band** (stopband edge - passband edge) gets narrower as a **percentage of sampling frequency** as M increases
- Narrower transition bands require more taps to achieve the same attenuation
- M=21 has 0.95% transition band → needs 1087 taps
- M=13 has 1.54% transition band → needs only 653 taps (40% fewer!)

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Correctness**: Compare boxcar vs FIR outputs for same dataset
2. **Frequency response**: Verify FIR filter meets 80 dB stopband spec (automatic, check logs)
3. **Passband ripple**: Verify ≤0.1 dB (automatic, check logs)
4. **Group delay**: Validate group delay handling (first N bars have startup transient)
5. **Performance**: Measure latency impact (should be <1% of tick processing time)
6. **Aliasing**: Compare spectral content beyond Nyquist (should be suppressed in FIR)
7. **Parameter scaling**: Verify normalization, winsorization, and jump guard work correctly

### Validation Checklist When Changing Bar Size

✅ Updated `ticks_per_bar`  
✅ Updated `normalization_window_bars` (keep ~2,600 tick window)  
✅ Updated `winsorize_bar_threshold` (scale by M_new/M_old)  
✅ Updated `max_bar_jump` (scale by M_new/M_old)  
✅ Verified startup log shows correct filter design  
✅ Monitored first N bars for startup transient (where N = group delay)  
✅ Checked normalization values are in expected range  
✅ Verified clipping frequency is similar (~0.5% of bars)  
✅ Confirmed jump guard triggers are rare (<0.1% of bars)  

## When to Use Each Method

### Use Boxcar when:
- Prototyping or development
- Performance is absolutely critical
- Aliasing is acceptable or handled downstream
- You need zero latency (no group delay)
- Post-bar filtering will handle frequency content

### Use FIR when:
- Production system requiring high-quality signals
- Downstream PLL filter bank or other frequency-sensitive processing
- Aliasing must be prevented (prevents high-freq noise from folding back)
- You need clean spectral characteristics
- The group delay is acceptable (part of your latency budget)
- Computational resources are available (typically <1% of CPU)

## Frequency Content Analysis

### What Gets Filtered for Different Bar Sizes

| Bar Size (M) | New Nyquist | Frequencies Removed | Oscillation Period Filtered |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|----------------------------|
| 13 ticks | 0.0385 Hz | >0.0385 Hz | Faster than 13 ticks |
| 21 ticks | 0.0238 Hz | >0.0238 Hz | Faster than 21 ticks |
| 34 ticks | 0.0147 Hz | >0.0147 Hz | Faster than 34 ticks |

**Key insight**: Smaller M (fewer ticks per bar) preserves more high-frequency content.

### For PLL Filter Banks

If your PLL filter bank operates on **bar-rate** data with Fibonacci periods defined in bars (e.g., 2-bar, 3-bar, 5-bar, 8-bar cycles), then:

**All bar sizes produce identical frequency content in the bar domain!**
- Both M=13 and M=21 have the same Nyquist in bar domain: 0.5 cycles/bar
- Both pass the same Fibonacci components: 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144+ bar cycles
- The only difference is latency and computational cost

**Recommendation**: Use M=13 for lower latency if your PLL operates on bar-domain data.

## Common Questions

**Q: Do I need to run a separate script to design the FIR filter?**  
A: No! The filter is automatically designed at startup based on your `ticks_per_bar` setting.

**Q: What if I want to use 13-tick bars instead of 21-tick bars?**  
A: Just change `ticks_per_bar = 13` in the config and adjust the related parameters (normalization window, thresholds). The FIR filter automatically redesigns for M=13.

**Q: How do I know if the filter was designed correctly?**  
A: Check the startup log for: `[ Info: FIR filter initialized decimation_factor=13 filter_length=653 group_delay=326`

**Q: Can I use other bar sizes like 8, 34, 55, or 89 ticks?**  
A: Yes! Any bar size works. The FIR filter automatically designs the optimal filter. Just remember to adjust the related parameters proportionally.

**Q: What's the computational cost?**  
A: FIR filtering performs N multiply-adds per tick, where N is the number of taps. For M=21, that's 1087 MACs/tick. At 10K ticks/sec, this is ~11M operations/sec, which is <1% of modern CPU capability.

**Q: What's the latency impact?**  
A: FIR introduces group delay = (N-1)/2 samples. For M=21 with 1087 taps, that's 543 samples of group delay. This means the filtered bar value is delayed by 543 ticks.

**Q: Does group delay affect my trading signals?**  
A: Yes, it adds latency. However, if you're processing historical data or the group delay is acceptable within your latency budget, FIR provides superior signal quality by preventing aliasing.

**Q: Can I see the filter frequency response before using it?**  
A: Yes, use the optional `scripts/design_bar_filter.jl` script to visualize the filter. Change the `M` value to your desired bar size and run it to see plots.

**Q: Why does M=21 need more taps than M=13?**  
A: The transition band for M=21 (0.95% of fs/2) is narrower than M=13 (1.54% of fs/2). Narrower transitions require more taps to achieve the same 80 dB attenuation.

## Future Enhancements
- Add polyphase decimation for improved efficiency (reduces computation by factor of M)
- Cache filter coefficients to avoid recomputation on restart
- Support variable passband/stopband specifications via config
- Add filter performance monitoring and adaptive design
